Natural_Language_Translator
===========================
I know there are several Lang. translator already out there 
but my goal is to make a Translator more flexible So,that nobody
has to follow any pattern just to run command in Linux.Write now
I have done it in most simplest way and I am trying to improw it 
day by day or maybe weekly.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
I hope I could make a good use of ruby language and build something 
useful and flexible enough,So that while using it people dont really
have to struggle with the pattern.

Cheers for Ruby !!
